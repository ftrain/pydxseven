# Python DX7 Cartridge Serializer

This code was generated by ChatGPT 4o using the following prompts:

> Write documentation for the specification of Yamaha DX7 cartridges. Include clear info on byte headers, checksums, final bytes, and clearly outline the number of voices. 

> Completely define each byte in a voice.

> Write a Python module that decodes and encodes the byte data in a voice.

> Write a cartridge module that loads and saves perfectly valid cartridges, calculating and confirming checksums. Use the voice module to load and serialize voices.

> Write a script that generates 32 slightly random voices — within normal parameters — and saves them as a valid cartridge.
> ... Narrow the parameters of the voices so that they are less random and more like common synthesizer tones.
> ... Change the random generator script further. Make the changes much more subtle, and make sure that the first voice always has a fixed ratio of 1. Don't change the transpose settings.
> ... Allow me to specify an output name at the command line, and to set the amount of overall randomness. Once that is set, the entire script should honor that constraint.
> ... Write a new command line script that creates a random Yamaha DX7 cartridge full of voices. Each voice should be bright, loud, and peppy, with a fun random name.

(It still doesn't do a good job with the last bit, but whatever. Can try more later.)

# Yamaha DX7 Cartridge Specification Documentation

The Yamaha DX7 synthesizer uses a unique file structure to store patches (voices) on its cartridges. This document outlines the byte-level specification of Yamaha DX7 cartridge files, including headers, checksums, final bytes, and the number of voices each cartridge contains. This information is essential for creating or editing DX7 cartridge files for accurate voice loading and saving.

---

## 1. **Cartridge Structure Overview**
Each Yamaha DX7 cartridge file (typically with a `.syx` or `.bin` extension) contains 32 voices. The DX7's memory architecture allows each voice (patch) to be defined individually, with a specific structure for parameters, headers, and metadata. These cartridges follow a strict byte order and layout for proper loading by the DX7.

---

## 2. **File Header**

- **Length:** 6 bytes
- **Description:** The header provides the initial identification for the cartridge and specifies the type of data being loaded.
- **Format:**
  - **Byte 0:** Fixed value `0xF0` (MIDI System Exclusive start byte).
  - **Byte 1:** Manufacturer ID for Yamaha, typically `0x43`.
  - **Byte 2:** Device/channel identifier (can vary but often set to `0x00` for the DX7).
  - **Byte 3:** Data type for voice data, usually `0x09` (indicating 32-voice data).
  - **Byte 4:** Data length MSB (Most Significant Byte), usually `0x20`.
  - **Byte 5:** Data length LSB (Least Significant Byte), usually `0x00`.

---

## 3. **Voice Data Structure**

Each DX7 voice in the cartridge is structured with a set of parameters that define its timbre and behavior. The 32 voices are stored sequentially.

- **Voice Count:** 32 voices, with each voice occupying 128 bytes.
- **Total Size of Voice Data:** 4,096 bytes (128 bytes per voice * 32 voices).

**Voice Parameter Breakdown:** Each voice includes parameters for operator settings, envelopes, pitch, modulation, etc., organized into the following sections:
  - **Algorithm and routing parameters:** Define operator relationships.
  - **Pitch and modulation parameters:** Define pitch envelope and modulation sensitivity.
  - **Operator parameters (x6):** Define the envelopes, frequency ratios, and amplitude scaling for each of the six operators.
  - **Miscellaneous parameters:** Name of the patch, level, etc.

---

## 4. **Checksum**

- **Position:** The checksum byte follows the voice data, specifically at byte 4102 in the file.
- **Calculation:** The checksum is calculated by summing all bytes from the start of the voice data to the end of the last voice (bytes 6 to 4101), taking the least significant 7 bits of the sum, and subtracting from 128 (`0x80`). This value ensures data integrity by detecting potential errors during data transmission.
- **Example Calculation:**  
  ```plaintext
  Checksum = 128 - (sum of bytes 6 to 4101) % 128
  ```

---

## 5. **End of File (Final Bytes)**

- **Length:** 1 byte
- **Description:** The end of the file is marked by a single `0xF7` byte, which serves as the System Exclusive (SysEx) end byte.
- **Position:** Byte 4103.

---

## 6. **Summary Table**

| Section                  | Byte Range      | Description                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Header                   | 0-5             | 6-byte header for SysEx start, Yamaha ID, etc.  |
| Voice Data               | 6-4101          | 32 voices, each occupying 128 bytes             |
| Checksum                 | 4102            | Checksum for voice data                         |
| End of File (SysEx End)  | 4103            | `0xF7` to signal end of SysEx message           |

---

## Example Cartridge Data Layout

Here's an example byte sequence for a typical DX7 cartridge file:

- **Header:** `F0 43 00 09 20 00`
- **Voice 1 to Voice 32 Data:** (Sequential 128-byte blocks for each voice)
- **Checksum:** Calculated byte after all voices
- **End Byte:** `F7`

## Important Notes

- **Data Editing:** Any modification to the voice data requires recalculating the checksum.
- **Cartridge Limits:** DX7 cartridges can only hold 32 voices. Exceeding this limit will result in data overflow and may cause the DX7 to reject the cartridge.

---

This structure ensures compatibility with the Yamaha DX7 and maintains data integrity through structured headers, defined data segments, and the checksum verification. Proper adherence to this specification is essential for creating functional and reliable DX7 cartridges.

# Voices

Each voice in a Yamaha DX7 cartridge is structured with 128 bytes that define the parameters for timbre, envelopes, and modulation for a given patch. Here is a complete breakdown of the byte structure and function for each voice in a DX7 cartridge file.

Each voice structure precisely outlines the settings for each operator, ensuring control over each aspect of sound design in the DX7’s FM synthesis framework. This specification allows fine control of sound characteristics, from envelope shaping to frequency modulation, across all six operators.
